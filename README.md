# Overview

This is a simple raytracer based on the book (series) [Raytracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/). In addition to the book which is rather short on the underlying mathematics I've used the famous, albeit difficult to obtain physically, [An introduction to raytracing](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/An-Introduction-to-Ray-Tracing-The-Morgan-Kaufmann-Series-in-Computer-Graphics-.pdf) for theoretical concepts of raytracing.

The result is this raytracer written in Go which allows to produce images such as

Using a bit of [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)'s magic, we are able to create animations such as
